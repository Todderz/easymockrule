= Example =

{{{
    public class SomeTest {

    @Rule
    public EasyMockRule mocks = new EasyMockRule(this);

    @StrictMock
    public SomeThing aMockedThing;

    @TestSubject
    public SomeOtherThing theTestSubject;

    @Test
    public void shouldDoSomething() throws Exception {

        // No need to create mocks

        // No need to set mocks into the test subject

        // Set expectations just like normal
        expect(aMockedThing.doStuff()).andReturn("stuff").atLeastOnce();

        // Only ever need this one call to replay any mocks in this test class
        mocks.replayAll();

        Object result = theTestSubject.doSomethingThatUsesTheMock();

        assertThat(result, is("what you expected"));

        // Verify all mocks is done automatically
    }
