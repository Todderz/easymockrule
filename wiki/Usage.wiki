#summary Basic usage instructions.

= Introduction =

You no longer need to create mocks, inject them into the test subject, or verify them manually.

= Example =

{{{
public class SomeTest {

    @Rule
    public EasyMockRule mocks = new EasyMockRule(this); // Give the rule a reference to the test class

    @StrictMock
    private SomeThing aMockedThing; // Or use @Mock or @NiceMock as needed

    @TestSubject
    private SomeOtherThing theTestSubject;  // No need to create instance if it has a no-arg constructor

    @Test
    public void shouldDoSomething() throws Exception {

        // No need to create mocks

        // No need to set mocks into the test subject

        // Set expectations just like normal
        expect(aMockedThing.doStuff()).andReturn("stuff").atLeastOnce();

        // Only ever need this one call to replay any mocks in this test class
        mocks.replayAll();

        Object result = theTestSubject.doSomethingThatUsesTheMock();

        assertThat(result, is("what you expected"));

        // "Verify" is done automatically for all mocks
    }
}
