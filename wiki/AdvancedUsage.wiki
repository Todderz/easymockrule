= Assisted Creation =

In some cases you need to create a mock on the fly during test execution, not as an annotated class field.

EasyMockRule provides the "createMock", "createNiceMock" and "createStrictMock" methods to create a mock on-demand.

The mock will not be injected into the TestSubject, but will be managed by the "replayAll()" method and automatically verified.

There are also versions that will create a name for the mock using the class name, but you should prefer to give a meaningful name for the mock that will make sense when seen in assertion failure messages:

{{{
    mocks.createMock("name for your mock", SomeType.class);
 
    // or
 
    mocks.createNiceMock("name for your mock", SomeType.class);
 
    // or
 
    mocks.createStrictMock("name for your mock", SomeType.class);
}}}
